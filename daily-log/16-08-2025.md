## Topic
File Permissions and Ownership

## Learned
- Linux is a multi-user system, permissions ensure security.
- Each file has an **owner**, a **group**, and **others**.
- Permissions are of three types:
  - `r` (read)
  - `w` (write)
  - `x` (execute)
- `ls -l` shows detailed permissions.
- Permissions can be changed using:
  - **Symbolic mode** (`chmod +x file`, `chmod -w file`)
  - **Numeric mode** (`chmod 755 file`)
- Ownership can be changed with:
  - `chown` (user and group)
  - `chgrp` (group only)

## Commands Practiced
```bash
ls -l
chmod +x script.sh
chmod 755 script.sh
chmod -w test.txt
sudo chown newuser file.txt
sudo chgrp developers project/
