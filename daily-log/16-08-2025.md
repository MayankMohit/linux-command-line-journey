## üìö Topic

**Manipulating Files and Directories**

## üöÄ What I Learned

* How to **create folders** using `mkdir`, including nested ones with `mkdir -p`.
* Copying files and directories with `cp` (don‚Äôt forget `-r` for folders).
* Moving and renaming files with `mv`.
* Deleting files and folders with `rm` (‚ö†Ô∏è danger zone).
* Making **hard links** (`ln`) and **symbolic links** (`ln -s`).
* Using **wildcards** (`*`, `?`, `[ ]`) to handle multiple files in one shot.

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands I Played With

```bash
# make a playground
mkdir playground && cd playground

# creating folders
mkdir -p project/src/assets

# copying files
echo "hello" > hello.txt
cp hello.txt hello_copy.txt

# moving/renaming
mv hello_copy.txt moved.txt

# deleting files/folders (carefully!)
rm moved.txt
rm -r old_folder/

# hard link & symlink
ln hello.txt hello_hard
ln -s hello.txt hello_symlink

# wildcards
touch file1.txt file2.txt fileA.txt test.TXT
ls f*
ls file?.txt
ls [[:upper:]]*
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges

* Remembering when to use `-r` (copying/deleting folders).
* Avoiding the **rm disaster** ‚Üí tested wildcards with `ls` first before deleting.
* Understanding the difference between **hard links** (real clone) and **symlinks** (shortcut).

## üéØ Next Steps

* Practice linking files across different directories.
* Get faster with wildcards for batch operations.
