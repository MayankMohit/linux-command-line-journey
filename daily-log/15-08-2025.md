## ✅ Work Done

* Finished **Chapter 3: Managing Files and Directories**.
* Learned and practiced:

  * Creating files → `touch`, `echo "text" > file.txt`.
  * Making directories → `mkdir`, and nested folders with `mkdir -p`.
  * Listing contents with `ls` variations (`-l`, `-a`, `-lh`).
  * Moving/renaming files → `mv old.txt new.txt`.
  * Copying files/directories → `cp` and `cp -r`.
  * Removing files/directories → `rm`, `rm -r` (⚠ dangerous).
  * Viewing files → `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`.

## ⚠️ Challenges

* Mixing up **`>` vs `>>`** when redirecting output.
* Handling **`rm -r`** safely without nuking important directories.
* Remembering to use quotes (`" "`) when filenames contain spaces.

## 🎯 Next Steps

* Do more hands-on practice:

  * Create, move, rename, and delete multiple files/folders quickly.
  * Chain commands together with `;` and `&&`.

* Try out redirection + pipes (`|`) with commands like:

  ```bash
  ls -l | less
  echo "hello" >> notes.txt && cat notes.txt
  ```
