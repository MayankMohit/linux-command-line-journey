## Work Done
- Completed **Chapter 3: Managing Files and Directories**.
- Learned how to:
  - Create files using `touch` and `echo`.
  - Create directories with `mkdir` and nested folders with `-p`.
  - List contents using `ls` with various options (`-l`, `-a`, `-lh`).
  - Move and rename files using `mv`.
  - Copy files and directories using `cp` and `cp -r`.
  - Delete files and directories using `rm` carefully.
  - View file contents using `cat`, `less`, `head`, and `tail`.

## Challenges
- Remembering the difference between `>` (overwrite) and `>>` (append) when writing to files.
- Using `rm -r` carefully to avoid accidental deletion of directories.

## Next Steps
- Practice creating, moving, renaming, and deleting multiple files and directories.
- Prepare for Chapter 4: **File Permissions and Ownership**.
- Try combining commands in one line (e.g., `mkdir new_folder; cd new_folder; touch file1.txt`).
