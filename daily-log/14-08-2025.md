# Daily Log â€” 2025-08-14

## Work Done
- Completed **Chapter 2** of the Linux Basics series.
- Learned about:
  - File system hierarchy and structure.
  - Understanding root (`/`), home (`/home`), and system directories like `/bin`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`.
  - Using commands to navigate:
    - `pwd` (print working directory)
    - `ls` (list files)
    - `cd` (change directory)
  - Relative vs. absolute paths.
  - Hidden files and directories (`.` and `..`, and files starting with `.`).
  - Using `ls -a` to show all files including hidden ones.

## Challenges
- Remembering the exact differences between absolute and relative paths.
- Understanding what each system directory is responsible for.

## Next Steps
- Practice using `cd` with both relative and absolute paths.
- Explore more about file permissions (`ls -l`) before moving on to Chapter 3.
- Get familiar with manual pages (`man command`) to self-learn commands.
