## Topic

Chapter 2 – Navigating the Filesystem

## Learned

* Linux filesystem is a **single tree**, starting from `/`.
* Difference between **absolute paths** (`/home/alex/Documents`) and **relative paths** (`Documents`).
* Commands to **navigate**:

  * `pwd` → show where I am
  * `ls` / `ls -l` / `ls -a` → see what’s inside
  * `cd`, `cd ..`, `cd /`, `cd ~` → move around
* Hidden files in Linux start with `.` (dotfiles).

## Commands Practiced

```bash
pwd
ls
ls -l
ls -a
cd Documents
cd ..
cd /
cd ~
cd -
```

## Challenges

1. Remembering when to use **absolute vs relative** paths.
2. Keeping track of where I am after moving multiple times.
3. Noticing that `ls` alone sometimes hides important files (needed `ls -a`).
