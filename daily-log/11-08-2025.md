## Topic

Chapter 1 – What is the Shell?

## Learned

* The difference between **Kernel**, **Shell**, **Terminal**, and how they interact.
* The role of **bash** as the default shell.
* Running basic system commands (`whoami`, `pwd`, `date`, `df`, `free`, `exit`).
* How to access **man pages** for built-in help.
* The meaning of the **shell prompt** and how to customize it temporarily.
* Using **command history** and **arrow keys** for navigation.
* Copy-paste behavior in the terminal (using mouse, not Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V).
* Focus policies: **click-to-focus** vs. **focus-follows-mouse**.

## Commands Practiced

```bash
whoami
pwd
date
df -h
free -h
man pwd
PS1="LinuxRocks> "
exit
```

## Challenges

1. Remembering that **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V** don’t work as copy-paste in terminals.
2. Getting used to **case sensitivity** (commands must be lowercase).
3. Adjusting to **new navigation habits**: arrow keys for history & editing instead of retyping everything.
