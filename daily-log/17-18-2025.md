# Daily Log – 17 August 2025

## Topic
Environment Variables and the Shell

## Learned
- Environment variables store session and system information.
- Common variables:
  - `HOME` → user’s home directory
  - `USER` → current username
  - `PATH` → directories searched for commands
- `$` is used to reference variables (e.g., `$HOME`).
- You can set variables temporarily:  
  `MYNAME="LinuxLearner"`
- Use `export` to make them available to child processes.
- Modify `PATH` to include custom script directories.
- Permanent variables are added to shell config files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`).
- Variables can be removed with `unset`.

## Commands Practiced
```bash
printenv
echo $HOME
echo $USER
echo $PATH
MYNAME="LinuxLearner"
export MYNAME
unset MYNAME
export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts
