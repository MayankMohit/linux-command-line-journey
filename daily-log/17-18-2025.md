## 📌 Commands Learned

### 🔎 `type`

* Tells you how Bash interprets a command name.
* Reveals if something is an alias, builtin, function, or an executable.
* Flags:

  * `type -a name` → show all matches in resolution order
  * `type -t name` → show only the type

---

### 📍 `which`

* Shows the **executable path** if it exists in `$PATH`.
* Does not detect aliases, builtins, or functions.
* Debugging tool when `$PATH` is messed up.

---

### 🆘 `help`

* Displays help for **builtins** only.
* Example: `help cd` → syntax + options.
* Use `help -m name` for manpage-style formatting.

---

### 📚 `man`

* Displays manual pages (most common doc system).
* Useful navigation: `/search`, `n`, `q`, `g`, `G`.
* Sections: `1` (commands), `5` (files), `8` (admin commands).
* Related: `man -k` = `apropos`, `man -f` = `whatis`.

---

### 🔍 `apropos`

* Searches all manpage names/descriptions for a keyword.
* Best when you don’t know the exact command but know the topic.

---

### 🏷️ `whatis`

* One-line summary from manpage DB.
* Quick check if a command is what you think it is.

---

### ℹ️ `info`

* GNU’s hyperlinked documentation system.
* Sometimes richer than man pages (especially for `coreutils`).
* Navigation: `n` (next), `p` (prev), `u` (up), `q` (quit).

---

### 🏷️ `alias`

* Create shortcuts for frequently used commands.
* Example: `alias ll='ls -alF'`.
* Remove with `unalias name`.
* Persist by adding to `~/.bashrc`.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

1. **Four types of commands**: executable programs, shell builtins, shell functions, aliases.
2. **Resolution order** when typing a command:

   1. Alias
   2. Function
   3. Builtin
   4. External executable (from `$PATH`).
3. Use `type` to diagnose ambiguous commands.
4. Aliases can shadow real commands → use `\command` to bypass.

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice

* Checked how `ls` resolves with `type ls` (alias + file).
* Used `which python3` to confirm the path.
* Read `help cd` to see builtin-only docs.
* Navigated `man ls` using `/pattern` and `n`.
* Ran `apropos directory` to discover related commands.
* Created alias `gs='git status'` and tested.

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Insights

* If command not found → check `$PATH`.
* If unexpected behavior → check if it’s an alias with `type`.
* If docs are too brief in `man` → try `info`.
* To bypass alias, prefix with `\`.

---

## ✅ Exercises to Reinforce

1. Add two aliases to `~/.bashrc` (e.g., `..`, `ll`).
2. Use `apropos` to discover at least 3 commands you didn’t know.
3. Compare outputs of `type echo`, `which echo`, and `help echo`.
4. Explore `man 5 passwd` and describe `/etc/passwd` fields.
