# Linux Command Line Journey

Welcome to my **hands-on journey through Linux**! 🐧
This repo documents my daily progress as I study ***The Linux Command Line* by William Shotts**, mixing book notes with my own experiments, tweaks, and learnings.

Every chapter → practical notes, examples you can run, and exercises I’ve completed.
Every day → a **daily log** of what I learned, mistakes I made, and commands I practiced.

## 💻 My Environment

I’m learning inside **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** on Windows 11, running **Ubuntu**.
All commands are tested here before being added.

### Installing WSL

If you’re on Windows 10/11, setting up WSL is simple:

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.
2. Run:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Restart when prompted.
4. Choose and install Ubuntu:

   ```powershell
   wsl --list --online
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu
   ```
5. Set your Linux username & password.
6. Launch Ubuntu from the Start Menu → you’re ready! 🎉

> ℹ️ On older Windows 10 (pre-2004), follow Microsoft’s official docs:
> [https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)
